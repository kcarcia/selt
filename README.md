# selt
selt is a tool used for running Selenium automation on graphical user 
interfaces on the web.

This tool is a work in progress. The code for selt can be found in run.py. 
However, this repository also includes an example test project. This will 
likely be moved into a separate repository at a later time, and selt will be 
turned into a standalone python package.

Currently, selt only supports the latest version of chrome, chrome-headless, 
firefox, and firefox-headless.

## Dependencies
* python
* selenium
* termcolor

## Usage

1- cd into your selt directory.

`
$ cd selt

2- Run your tests.

`
$ python run.py`
